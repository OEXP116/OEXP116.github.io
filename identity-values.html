        <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</h2>
        <p>
          During a freelance project, a client asked me to implement a feature that would collect user data without their consent. I had to weigh up the potential business value for the client versus my own ethical stance on user privacy. Ultimately, I chose not to include the feature, explaining to the client the importance of ethical data collection practices and how it would build long-term trust with their users. Looking back, I’m proud of the decision because it reinforced my commitment to responsible tech development and established trust with the client.

        <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up in Chile, I was raised with strong family values and a deep sense of community, which have shaped my approach to both life and work. Moving to New Zealand exposed me to diverse perspectives, which further solidified my belief in inclusivity and collaboration. My cultural background has instilled in me a strong work ethic and resilience, while the people I’ve met in New Zealand have encouraged open-mindedness and the importance of work-life balance.

        <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
        <p>
          One of my key strengths is adaptability. I’ve had to quickly learn new technologies and tools to meet client needs as a freelance developer. My problem-solving ability allows me to break down complex challenges into manageable steps, ensuring I stay on track during my learning. Additionally, my collaborative nature helps me thrive in team settings, where I can both contribute and learn from others.

        <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
        <p>
          One limitation I’ve identified is time management, especially when balancing multiple projects or commitments. This sometimes leads to stress when deadlines approach. To counter this, I’ve started using productivity tools like task managers and calendars to organize my work. I also make an effort to break tasks into smaller goals, which helps me stay focused and less overwhelmed.

        <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</h2>
        <p>
          During a group project at university, there was tension between team members over different approaches to solving a problem. I proposed that we take a step back, list out the pros and cons of each approach, and try to find a middle ground. While the situation improved, the communication gap persisted. Looking back, I realize that having a clear, structured discussion earlier on would have been more effective. In the future, I would suggest regular check-ins and clearer roles to reduce miscommunication.
