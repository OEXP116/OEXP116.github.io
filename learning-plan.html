  <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

  <h2 class="section-title">1. Long-term Goal and Career Pathway</h2>
  <p>
    My long-term goal is to build a career as a proficient full-stack software developer, ideally specializing in web development using technologies like C#, .NET, React.js, and JavaScript. I aim to use the skills I gain during Bootcamp to contribute to real-world applications, with a focus on creating impactful solutions for users. I envision working in a collaborative environment where innovation and continuous learning are valued.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">2. Hopes for the Skills Gained</h2>
  <p>
    I hope to refine my full-stack development skills, particularly in areas like front-end responsiveness and back-end efficiency. Once I leave Dev Academy, I’d like to work in roles that challenge my creativity and technical problem-solving. My goal is to contribute to projects that benefit industries such as e-commerce, education, or healthcare.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">3. Strengths and Limitations for Bootcamp</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> My programming experience with various languages, especially in C#, .NET, and SQL, will be a strength. Additionally, I have a problem-solving mindset that helps me break down complex challenges.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> I still lack confidence in front-end development, particularly in building highly polished UIs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">4. Non-Technical Challenges at Bootcamp</h2>
  <p>
    One major non-technical challenge will be balancing the workload with my personal life, as I’m married with two kids. Staying organized and managing time effectively during an intensive program like Bootcamp could also be challenging.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">5. Non-Technical Skills to Develop</h2>
  <p>
    I’d like to develop stronger communication skills, particularly in explaining technical concepts to non-technical team members. Improving my leadership and teamwork skills in group projects is another priority, as well as enhancing my ability to receive and give constructive feedback.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">6. Expectations from the Bootcamp Team</h2>
  <p>
    I expect the Bootcamp team to provide clear guidance, timely feedback, and constructive support when I struggle. I appreciate a balance between independence and assistance, with a focus on problem-solving techniques that can help me develop autonomy.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">7. Expectations of Myself on Bootcamp</h2>
  <p>
    I expect myself to stay committed to the learning process, engage actively in group work, and seek help when needed. I will push myself to step out of my comfort zone, especially in areas I find challenging, such as front-end work or presenting my ideas to the group.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title">8. Managing Workload and Seeking Help</h2>
  <p>
    To manage my workload, I plan to allocate specific blocks of time each day for focused work and set clear, achievable goals. I will regularly review my progress and seek help early when I hit obstacles, using both peers and instructors as resources. Additionally, I will stay organized using project management tools like Trello or GitHub Issues.
  </p>





  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to become a senior software developer, leading projects that make a tangible impact on people’s lives. I’m particularly interested in building scalable, high-performance web applications and contributing to open-source projects. Eventually, I’d like to take on leadership roles, mentoring junior developers and possibly managing teams.
        </p>
      
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths include my curiosity and willingness to learn independently, which helps me pick up new programming languages or technologies quickly. However, I sometimes struggle with perfectionism, which can slow down my progress. I’m learning to strike a balance between striving for quality and knowing when to move forward, particularly in fast-paced environments.
        </p>
      
        <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          I’d like to further develop my leadership and communication skills. While I’ve worked well in teams, I know that clear communication is essential for successful collaboration. I’m also keen to improve my conflict resolution skills, so I can manage difficult situations with diplomacy and tact in future team settings.
        </p>
      
        <h2>How will you manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators, and industry/community representatives?</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to stay organized by setting daily and weekly goals and using a project management tool to track progress. I believe in maintaining open communication with peers and facilitators, ensuring that I’m clear about expectations and deadlines.
        </p>
      
        <h2>What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
        <p>
          When I feel overwhelmed, I step back and assess priorities, taking a short break to clear my mind. I also find it helpful to discuss challenges with peers or mentors, as a fresh perspective can often help solve problems.
        </p>
      
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
        <p>
          I commit to reaching out for help when needed, whether it’s through scheduled office hours with facilitators or asking questions in group chats. I understand the importance of not letting challenges pile up, so I’ll address them as soon as they arise.
        </p>
      
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
        <p>
          I expect the Facilitation team to provide clear guidance, constructive feedback, and support throughout the programme. I also hope they create a learning environment where it’s safe to ask questions and explore ideas, with encouragement for collaboration between students.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
        <p>
          As a father of two, I’ll need to manage my time carefully. I have commitments for school drop-offs and family time in the evenings. I plan to schedule my learning around these times, and I’ll communicate any potential conflicts in advance to ensure I stay on track.
