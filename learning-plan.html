        <h2>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to become a senior software developer, leading projects that make a tangible impact on people’s lives. I’m particularly interested in building scalable, high-performance web applications and contributing to open-source projects. Eventually, I’d like to take on leadership roles, mentoring junior developers and possibly managing teams.
        </p>
      
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths include my curiosity and willingness to learn independently, which helps me pick up new programming languages or technologies quickly. However, I sometimes struggle with perfectionism, which can slow down my progress. I’m learning to strike a balance between striving for quality and knowing when to move forward, particularly in fast-paced environments.
        </p>
      
        <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          I’d like to further develop my leadership and communication skills. While I’ve worked well in teams, I know that clear communication is essential for successful collaboration. I’m also keen to improve my conflict resolution skills, so I can manage difficult situations with diplomacy and tact in future team settings.
        </p>
      
        <h2>How will you manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators, and industry/community representatives?</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to stay organized by setting daily and weekly goals and using a project management tool to track progress. I believe in maintaining open communication with peers and facilitators, ensuring that I’m clear about expectations and deadlines.
        </p>
      
        <h2>What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
        <p>
          When I feel overwhelmed, I step back and assess priorities, taking a short break to clear my mind. I also find it helpful to discuss challenges with peers or mentors, as a fresh perspective can often help solve problems.
        </p>
      
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
        <p>
          I commit to reaching out for help when needed, whether it’s through scheduled office hours with facilitators or asking questions in group chats. I understand the importance of not letting challenges pile up, so I’ll address them as soon as they arise.
        </p>
      
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
        <p>
          I expect the Facilitation team to provide clear guidance, constructive feedback, and support throughout the programme. I also hope they create a learning environment where it’s safe to ask questions and explore ideas, with encouragement for collaboration between students.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
        <p>
          As a father of two, I’ll need to manage my time carefully. I have commitments for school drop-offs and family time in the evenings. I plan to schedule my learning around these times, and I’ll communicate any potential conflicts in advance to ensure I stay on track.
