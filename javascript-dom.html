    <h1>JavaScript, DOM, and Control Flow Explained</h1>

    <h2>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: A Simple Analogy</h2>
    <p>Think of a website like building a house. <strong>HTML</strong> is the framework, creating the structure of the house with rooms, walls, and doors. <strong>CSS</strong> is the design â€” it decides the colors, layout, and style, making everything look good. <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the electricity, bringing the house to life by making it interactive. Together, these three work to build, style, and power a website.</p>

    <h2>Control Flow and Loops: Like Making Coffee</h2>
    <p><strong>Control flow</strong> in JavaScript is like following a recipe step by step. If you need to repeat an action, like making multiple cups of coffee, you use a <strong>loop</strong>. The loop allows you to repeat a task, like making three cups of coffee, without needing to write out the steps over and over again.</p>

    <h2>The DOM: The Map of a Webpage</h2>
    <p>The <strong>DOM</strong> (Document Object Model) is like a map of a webpage that JavaScript can use to change or update parts of it. It allows JavaScript to interact with the page, like changing text or images, without needing to reload the whole page.</p>

    <h2>Arrays vs. Objects: Data Organizers</h2>
    <p><strong>Arrays</strong> are like lists where data is stored in a specific order, while <strong>objects</strong> are more like labeled boxes, where each piece of information has a name. Both are used to store and organize data efficiently in JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Functions: Your Task Manager</h2>
    <p>A <strong>function</strong> is like a personal assistant that you give a set of instructions to. Instead of repeating the same task, you use a function to handle it whenever needed. Functions make your code more organized and reusable, saving time and effort.</p>
