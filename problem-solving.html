    <h1>Problem-Solving Reflection</h1>

    <h2>1. Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
    <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
    <p>There was a time I was building a simple web app, and I spent hours trying to figure out why my button wasn’t working. The app was supposed to add items to a list when the button was clicked, but nothing happened.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
    <p>I went back and reviewed my code line by line, but still couldn’t see the issue. I tried Googling solutions, checked online forums, but no luck. I even used the "rubber ducky" method, where you explain your problem out loud. Finally, I checked the console and found a small typo in my button’s JavaScript function—I'd written "addItmes" instead of "addItems".</p>
    
    <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
    <p>At first, I was confused. As time went on, frustration started to build, and I felt like the problem was much more complicated than it actually was. When I finally spotted the typo, I laughed at how simple the solution was and felt a sense of relief.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
    <p>I learned that small details can cause big problems in code and that checking the console for error messages early on could save a lot of time.</p>

    <h2>2. Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
    <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
    <p>I was developing a feature for a client’s website where they wanted a search bar that filtered results as the user typed. With a large database, I thought this might be tricky.</p>

    <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
    <p>I used a technique called "debouncing" to prevent the search function from sending too many requests at once. I also paginated the results to avoid overloading the webpage with too much data at once.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
    <p>I felt confident because I had encountered similar issues before, and I knew that performance optimization was the key. It was incredibly satisfying when the search worked smoothly and responsively.</p>

    <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
    <p>I learned how useful debouncing and pagination are for improving the performance and user experience of a website.</p>

    <h2>3. Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Fairly confident. It helps break down complex problems, but I don’t always use it for smaller tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Trying Something:</strong> Very confident. Experimenting is often key in finding a solution when stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong> It works surprisingly well. Talking through problems helps clarify my thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> Very confident. Error messages usually point me in the right direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> I use this all the time to track what’s happening in my code and troubleshoot effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Googling:</strong> Extremely confident. Google is a great resource, and someone else has usually encountered the same issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Asking Peers for Help:</strong> Becoming more comfortable with this, realizing that collaboration is a learning opportunity.</li>
        <li><strong>Asking Coaches for Help:</strong> I hesitate sometimes, thinking I should figure things out alone, but I’m working on this.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving Your Process with Reflection:</strong> Reflection helps refine my approach for future problems. I’m learning to appreciate its value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Reluctance to Ask for Help</h2>
    <p><strong>A time you were reluctant to ask for help:</strong></p>
    <p>When I was stuck on that button issue, I didn’t want to ask for help because it seemed so small. I felt I should be able to solve it on my own, especially since it was basic.</p>

    <p><strong>What made you reluctant?</strong></p>
    <p>I didn’t want to admit that I was struggling with something simple. I was worried it might make me seem less capable, and I also didn’t want to bother anyone with an easy problem.</p>

    <p><strong>What might you try differently next time?</strong></p>
    <p>Next time, I’ll remind myself that everyone gets stuck sometimes, and asking for help—even on small issues—is completely fine. It’s better to solve the problem quickly than waste time. I’ll also see asking for help as a learning opportunity.</p>
